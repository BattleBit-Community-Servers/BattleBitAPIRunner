# BattleBitAPIRunner

Modular battlebit community server api runner. Lets you host community servers with modules without having to code.

## Features

- Start the community server API endpoint for your server to connect to
- Modules are simple C# source files `.cs`
- Modules support module dependencies
- Modules support binary dependencies (Newtonsoft.Json, System.Net.Http, ...)

## Configuration

```
{
  "IP": "127.0.0.1",
  "Port": 29595,
  "ModulePath": "./modules",
  "Modules": [ "C:\\path\\to\\specific\\ModuleFile.cs" ],
  "DependencyPath": "./dependencies"
}
```
- IP: Listening IP
- Port: Listening port
- ModulePath: Path to the folder containing all modules (is created if not exist)
- Modules: Array of individual module file paths
- DependencyPath: Path to the folder containing all binary dependencies (dlls)

## Usage

Download the latest release, unpack, configure and start `BattleBitAPIRunner`.
A modules and dependencies folder will be created in the same directory as the executable, if you have not specified a different path in the configuration file.
Modules are loaded upon startup. To reload modules the application has to be restarted.

Place modules in the modules folder or specify their path in the configuration file.
Place binary dependencies in the dependencies folder.

## Developing modules

Modules are .net 6.0 C# source code files. They are compiled in runtime, so you can change them ad-hoc.
To debug a module, simply attach your debugger to the BattleBitAPIRunner process.

To create a module, create a (library) .net 6.0 C# project.
Set `ImplicitUsings` to `disabled`, for example by unchecking `Enable implicit global usings to be declared by the project SDK.` in the project settings.
Add a nuget dependency to [BBRAPIModules](https://www.nuget.org/packages/BBRAPIModules).
In your module source file, have exactly one public class which has the same name as your file and inherit `BBRAPIModules.BattleBitModule`.
Your module class now has all methods of the BattleBit API, such as `OnConnected`.

To use module dependencies, for each dependent module, add the module source file to your project and add a `[RequireModule(typeof(DependantModule))]` attribute to your class.
You can assign all your dependant modules to fields in the `OnModulesLoaded` method which gets called once all modules are available.
Use `this.Server.GetModule<DependantModule>()` to retrieve the module instance of the server.
